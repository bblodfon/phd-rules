As you may already know, to obtain a doctorate degree and finally be called a Doctor1, you need to submit a dissertation towards the end of your studies. During my efforts to produce a respectable, well-written, paper-based PhD thesis, I followed a personal list of rules. It is these rules, and the principles behind them, that I present in this rulebook. They are the direct result of my personal travel through the PhD thesis writing ordeal and the lessons I learned from that experience. I cannot really say if these guidelines are also applicable to a monograph-based thesis or a thesis about a subject in a research field entirely different from my own (my PhD was in Computational Biology), but I would expect some of them to be. You can find several sources on the internet nowadays, providing advice on how to write a PhD thesis. Two excellent books exist on the subject (Eco 2015; Murray 2017), as well as several online blogs and presentations. I admit that I haven’t thoroughly read all of these sources but I have noticed similarities between the guidelines presented in some of these works and my rules. All in all, it might be wise to check them out as well if you are interested in good advice on thesis writing. Getting expert opinion never hurts, or so they say. How can I write more efficiently? How can I organize the work that needs to be done in a manner that will increase my productivity? How to better prepare myself psychologically for the task ahead? How to regulate external factors to my advantage? If you are struggling with similar questions, then keep reading. In the end, I found some answers to the above questions - at least ones that seemed to work for me, and helped me get the job done. I formulated these answers into a list of guidelines. I also tried to extract the essence or central idea behind each rule. This allowed me to analyze in depth the underlying principles that are key to understanding why these rules actually work (or I think that they do). Therefore, every rule has its own theoretical background, in case you want to know more details about why each one was included in the first place. Who is the intended reader? To answer this question, let me start by saying that a PhD thesis is not a paper or an essay. You can not finish a PhD thesis in five days of intense writing and use the weekend to do some refinements, all while having pizza every day to boost your psychological well-being. But a scientific paper can be written this way actually (and surely without the pizza). Numerous guidelines exist for writing a paper, and an excellent advice is to structure it in the Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion format to facilitate your writing in an efficient manner. Nonetheless, if you are a person that thinks you can write a scientific thesis in one week, then the following text is not meant for you (and I wish you good luck!). The presented rules are aimed towards the strugglers, the good-working people who may turn lazy and procrastinate when they even think of the prospect of having to write scientific prose. These people usually think “I am better at the lab or when writing code,” “too much effort to produce almost nothing,” “extremely boring” and “who is going to read it anyway?” The sad fact is that such thoughts are true most of the time. You will need to overcome such tricks of the mind in order to finish your thesis. It is clearly a psychological battle. Moreover, the process of writing a PhD thesis is similar to writing a book, so it is really hard work, apart from being mentally and psychologically draining. Given its serious nature (it’s a doctoral degree after all), it makes sense to be properly prepared for it. The presented rules are a step towards this direction and may thus be of help to you. A few words about the layout of the rules are in order. The first five rules relate to things that need to be in place and figured out before you even start writing. The next three rules explain what to do everyday during the writing period. That’s why I have split this collection of rules to Before and During writing. The Epilogue provides some general advice and states the final take-home messages (so no rules in there). I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this text and that it proves useful to your goals. John Zobolas, July 2021. As in “Dr. John,” a title with a nice ring to it! You can check my PhD thesis here: https://bblodfon.github.io/my-phd-thesis/↩︎ "],["before_1.html", "Before writing Rule 1: Read the damn papers", " Before writing Rule 1: Read the damn papers What exactly is a PhD thesis? I believe that the answer is simple: the thesis is the story of your PhD journey, written by the main character (that’s you). So how to shape such a story? Let’s start from the beginning. You are about to write a scientific thesis and for the sake of the argument let’s say that you already have some results to write about or even better, papers published.2 You have to have some background knowledge as well. Your work has to fit in a larger picture, be part of a larger story. To write your PhD story you need to know the basic constituents of a thesis. In a nutshell, the PhD thesis incorporates three components. First, it lays out the contextual framework of the scientific subject you are writing about (background). Second, it presents the problems that you as a scientist faced, along with what you did to solve them (results). Lastly, it includes some discussion points and potential future work. To formulate such a story and embellish it with the details of your own PhD journey, the knowledge you’ve acquired over the course of your PhD will play a significant role. The most prominent source of such knowledge is scientific literature. Most people think that the PhD thesis is a strict, formal writing work. These people are wrong. You see, scientific writing does not necessarily mean the absence of creative writing. To write a story, you need to have a certain degree of imagination. But to integrate your scientific results into such a story and create a coherent narrative, you need to know about the subject you will be writing about. This means that you need to have a certain level of background knowledge as well, the main source of which is scientific papers. That’s also where you are going to find the citations you need for your thesis. Of course the papers are not the only source of knowledge you will have access to during your PhD. Taking advantage of other forms of knowledge dissemination, such as courses, workshops and conferences is your own responsibility. Use every possible means necessary to learn as much as possible about the subject you will be writing about. The discussions you have with your supervisors and colleagues are also going to be decisive in shaping your knowledge. “To write, you need to read” as many people have said. If you have reached the final stage of your PhD and haven’t read a single paper (which I think is almost impossible), you are like a soldier standing on the front line with no weapons. Your chances are better if you stand prepared for the battle ahead. So, arm yourself with knowledge. Start reading early in your PhD. You will still have a pile of papers to read during the writing phase of your PhD (see Rule 2). The main point here is that the core of the reading material should be read before that phase starts. Performing your usual PhD duties can be extremely rewarding, but focusing only on working and not on reading can have a detrimental effect on your thesis writing. Don’t fall under the wrong impression. Reading is of paramount importance to a successful PhD. Read the damn papers before you start writing. If you have no results, in any form that satisfy the criteria set by your academic institution, well, that’s another problem entirely, one that I honestly hope that you find a solution for. Either way, my assumption here is that you have some results to write about, which will be integrated into the story of your PhD thesis.↩︎ "],["before_2.html", "Rule 2: Read abstracts and reviews", " Rule 2: Read abstracts and reviews Here’s another piece of advice if you are close to the end of your PhD (let’s say around half to one year before submission) and you have a lot of papers in your to-read list: focus on abstracts and review papers. The assumption here is that you don’t need all the details from a paper, just the main take-home messages. Abstracts were created exactly for that reason. Some papers nowadays also include a Highlights section, facilitating a quick overview of the key results. Don’t spend your time reading the Methods section of a paper, though a quick look at the figures and the Discussion section can only be beneficial. Don’t waste your time on technical papers at this point, you will rarely need them if at all. Reviews will point you to other important papers that you may have missed. A good review paper is one where you have the possibility of reading about the work from other papers, in a way that is embedded in a larger story, similar to what you will be doing in your thesis writing. So you might want to spend a considerate amount of time reading reviews rather than any other type of scientific paper at this point of your PhD period. By reading abstracts and reviews, you most probably will obtain pieces of information that may seem unconnected to what you already know. What is important to remember is that you have to make the connections and make that knowledge your own. Reading by itself is not enough. So, what is the best way to assimilate knowledge? To answer that, let’s assume that you have an internal knowledge representation structure, which I like to think of as a tree (let’s call it your own tree of knowledge). That tree is going to be the main source for your PhD story (see Rule 1) and that is why it is extremely important to take good care of it. You have to help that tree grow. The knowledge you’ve acquired from reading scientific papers needs to be a part of that tree. One technique to accomplish exactly that, i.e. integrate new information into your internal tree of knowledge, is force remembering. This means that you have to force yourself to think about what you have been reading at times when you are doing something else (walking, cooking, e.g. take your pick). The simplest way to start remembering is by repeating in your mind words and sentences that you’ve read (or your own variations of them) and enter a process of internal dialogue with yourself. You start asking questions and you try to find answers to them. During this cognitive exercise, you subject the information you have started remembering to analysis, visualization and interpretation. The goal of this process is to gain a deeper understanding of what you’ve read, and incorporate that into your own knowledge tree. It might be of help to think of this whole mental activity in a visual manner: refining pieces of information and attaching them at appropriate branches in your knowledge tree! Using the aforementioned remembering technique along with your reading practice, will help you build your own personalized tree of knowledge, fine-tuned to the subject you will be writing about in your PhD thesis. Moreover, the tree’s size as well as depth will be considerably increased. Note that any other mnemonic or knowledge assimilation technique might work as well. The key point is to be active in your reading and efficiently absorb knowledge. As Confucius once said, “Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.” So nourish your tree with knowledge, give it the water and sunlight that it deserves! Read mainly abstracts and reviews during the last months of your PhD. "],["before_3.html", "Rule 3: Organize your story into chapters", " Rule 3: Organize your story into chapters Before the actual process of writing begins, you need to create the basic structure of your thesis. Structure is the key concept here. You don’t need to worry about the actual content of the thesis at this point. What is important is to build the necessary foundation, upon which you will be adding content at a later stage. But which are the main factors that can assist you in constructing such a foundation? First, the structure of your thesis will be shaped to a large degree by your knowledge tree (see Rule 2). So with no reading, there is no knowledge tree, and thus the creation of such structure becomes almost impossible. Second, it is your creative ability and imagination that will help you shape a coherent story about your PhD work. The integration of these two factors deserves a bit of clarification. The crucial question here is this: how can someone write a PhD story? Here is a way to construct your PhD story: first, find the central idea of your work. This idea should be directly related to the problem you are trying to solve. Next, expand this idea by elaborately formulating it as a sequence of sub-ideas with backup storylines (largely influenced by your accomplishments, i.e. your papers). Think and refine these sub-ideas, until you reach a point where you can write down single sentences, each capturing a different sub-idea in the most clear possible manner. Then, use these sentences to write your chapter titles. These sentences should be enough to create the outline of your thesis abstract as well (so two birds with one stone!). If you do that, in a way, you will have managed to create a map of your knowledge tree with the chapters corresponding to the different, possibly intersecting areas of that map. You can think of this mapping process like adding a certain level of semantics to your knowledge tree. And that’s the whole point of doing this! You see, without semantics, how will you be able to reason with the knowledge you possess, connect the results you have and write your PhD story? On the practical side, you should aim for a structured draft document with proper chapter titles. Each chapter should include some rough notes and comments, representing your ideas of what you should write there in the future. The notes can of course be incomplete or miss contextual detail at this stage. The process to generate these comments and ideas in each chapter is similar to brainstorming. That’s where your creative side needs to shine. And yes, you are not writing a novel, but a certain amount of vision is required to create the framework of your PhD thesis story. It personally took me around one week to think and write down the ideas that constituted the structure of my PhD story, so my advice to you is to plan accordingly for this. Obviously, without structure and order in your initial thesis draft, you will only make your future writing work way more harder than it could be. In conclusion, the proposed modular way of creating the story of your thesis will be extremely beneficial for the ensuing long-term writing work. Organize your PhD story into coherent interconnected ideas, and write them down as chapter titles with additional comments and notes. "],["before_4.html", "Rule 4: Make a PhD timetable", " Rule 4: Make a PhD timetable A PhD thesis can not be written in one week. Get this through your head. It is hard, maybe even the hardest thing you have to do during your PhD. It is going to be a painful task for most of you (it was for me). So schedule it in a proper time-wise manner. Do not wait until it’s just two weeks before the deadline to start writing. Here is a proposal: make a document with your PhD plan. Write down in that document the important things that need to be done in the last six months of your PhD, preferably in some chronological order.3 Examples of things to write can be submission of papers, finishing data analyses or other leftover work, writing the thesis, preparing for the defence, sending some important emails, etc. Allocate at least two months of your time for the writing of the thesis. That’s a minimum proposed time frame and it might be far from ideal for you. Time equals money as they say, and that’s definitively the case for the PhD. So you might not want to spend too much of your time in thesis writing. On the other hand, you surely don’t want to underestimate the time that is required for such a colossal task. Therefore, you need to make a well-balanced estimate and plan your thesis writing accordingly. How can then someone derive such an estimate? For starters, you need to understand that the exact amount of time that is necessary to finish the thesis writing is hard to predict. The reason for this is that during such a large time period, your life is going to be influenced by a lot of factors. Some of these factors are uncontrollable and there is no way to prepare for them (the phenomenon also simply known as “life happens”). Some other factors are directly related to the practical task at hand and can thus be more easily predicted and regulated to your advantage. Using this knowledge, you can make a rough calculation of how much time it will take to write your PhD thesis. I personally think three factors are of significant importance to derive such an estimate. First, the format of the thesis, i.e. a paper-based thesis or a monograph, the latter of which will surely require more time to finish. Second, your personal writing speed, measured in the amount of chapters that you will be able to write on average in a specified time period (usually a week). Third, the number of chapters you need to write. Choosing the format of the thesis should be fairly obvious, based on common practices in your research field, the regulations of your academic institution and the existence or not of published PhD work (papers). Moreover, you should already have a pretty good estimate on the amount of total chapters, based on the modular way of constructing your PhD story as was explained in Rule 3. Then all that is left, is for you to make an educated guess of your writing speed. The combination of the aforementioned three factors will then help you make a realistic estimation of how long the PhD thesis writing will take. Let me share with you my personal experience on this matter. My thesis was paper-based. Following the rules in the section During writing, I was writing one to two thesis chapters per week. These were chapter drafts, so definitely not polished material. Therefore, my minimum writing speed was around one chapter per week. Continuing, I had a total of eight chapters to write + the abstract (derived from my initial story structure), which let’s say was equivalent to approximately nine chapters. Worst case scenario, I write one chapter per week, so a total of nine weeks are required. Best case scenario, I write two chapters per week, so a total of five weeks are required (rounding it up). Chapter size plays a huge role as you can probably guess. The proposed estimate of two months time is somewhere between five and nine weeks and closer to the second (the maximum of the two). So, eight weeks, equal to two months, sounded like a good deadline for my writing project. In the end, I finished the thesis writing in seven weeks, which was one week before the deadline. That included also reviewing the edits and comments from my supervisor and several rewrites. The important thing to remember here is that the calculation of your thesis time frame is going to be a personal rough estimate. Therefore, using an average writing speed of one chapter per week without further thought is justifiable (see Rule 7 on how to have more control over this). To summarize, my advice is to 1) calculate the number of chapters you are going to write 2) directly translate that number to weeks and 3) round it up to months.4 Responsibly follow the time schedule you set up for yourself and be aware to not procrastinate on your thesis writing. This has also been stated more empirically as the notion that “work expands to fill the time available for its completion” (Parkinson’s Law). Procrastination can lead to unpleasant and stressful days before the thesis submission, that anyone would gladly dispense with. I have seen people doing rewrites, last minute additions, or otherwise work that could have been done a week or so ago, if properly scheduled. I have heard of people literally running to submit a printed copy in their respective department one hour before the deadline. Doesn’t sound too good to me. It’s a million times better to be prepared and follow your time plan religiously. Try to schedule your thesis writing in an anticipatory manner. This will happen when unfortunate scenarios that you can personally deal with, are managed to a satisfying degree. See also related discussion in the Epilogue. Make a PhD timetable and allocate a realistic time frame for your thesis writing. Of course you can make such a plan document from the start of your PhD. I just want to stress here the importance of including in this document what needs to be done during the last stages of your PhD.↩︎ Remember to round up the resulting number to months! A basic arithmetic example is appropriate here. If you have a total of \\(11\\) chapters, the time required to write them down would be calculated as follows: \\(\\frac{11 \\text{ chapters }}{1 \\text{ chapter/week }}=11 \\text{ weeks } \\approx 12 \\text{ weeks }\\) (closest multiple of \\(4\\)), which is equal to \\(3\\) months, assuming that \\(1\\) month is equal to \\(4\\) weeks.↩︎ "],["before_5.html", "Rule 5: Select several diverse workplaces", " Rule 5: Select several diverse workplaces Continuing from the previous rules, now you know what to do to have the proper background (read papers) and how to read more efficiently (read abstract and reviews mostly). You also know how you can lay out your upcoming writing work in a document (the skeleton of the story) and make a time-wise plan with regard to when you are going to start and finish the writing. An extremely important factor that will influence your writing days is the environment where you will be doing the writing. This is one of the most important rules in the present guideline list. My argument here is two-fold: first, make sure you check and have your working environment ready for the task ahead and second, have at your disposal several options for places that you could use to do some writing. But first things first. When the prospect of writing a PhD thesis is on the horizon, usually we resort to the most suitable of all places to complete such a task: our home. The reasons are multiple. Quiet, which makes it easy to focus. No disturbances, no interactions either. Easy to regulate and make it fit to your needs and standards. Not to mention, access to chicken and toilet without too much of a trouble. Nonetheless, there might still be things that require your immediate attention to make it the ideal environment for the ensuing writing work. For example, do you have a proper screen (if that’s what is best for you), comfortable chair and desk? Access to some decent view which is always nice to have? I can not advise you on what is the perfect writing home environment since this is largely personal, but I can insist that you spend the time required to make it as ideal for you as possible. Make sure that the basic preconditions are there to efficiently work from home. If you have already passed one (or more) corona quarantines, then you know exactly what I am talking about. So, home is one place where you will be doing some writing. What’s our next candidate? Well, usually our working place. Since you are writing a PhD thesis, I would guess that it is your office at a university. Apply the same reasoning here and think, “What can I do to make my work office a better place, suitable for the upcoming writing work?” You could add some family pictures for inspiration perhaps. Is the surface of the desk clean, with no coffee cups or papers scattered here and there? If not, then how do you expect to write something ordered in such a chaotic environment? Maybe you can start by cleaning your desk, a certain level of tidiness can surely be of some help. Or maybe you can forget all about working from the office, since it is a cubicle workspace with lots of other students and you are annoyed by that. Then, how about the university library? Or some other cozy place in the university that you may know of? An inside cafeteria perhaps, at suitable times? A nice suggestion is to book a specific room for some hours once every week, motivating you to be in that place and do some writing. All in all, a university can be the host of several writing spots which you should know about beforehand, so do your spatial research as well! Having a provision of different places (and backup places) suitable for writing sessions, is a central element to this rule. The keyword here is diversity. It is one of the few principles that you can apply to break the monotony of writing. Ok, so you have all your standard workplaces (home and office) figured out. Sometimes we need the absolute quiet of our home, sometimes we get inspired by having a conversation in our office and seeing a few of our university colleagues. Great. Now extend this concept a bit further. How about working from a café for a change? Cafés can be fairly quiet places during regular working days and hours. I like to view them as libraries with a bit more noise than usual and constant music in the background, a combination that makes up for an alternative working environment. Coordinating also with a friend might actually be a good idea. Being voluntarily exposed to social environments might trigger thoughts in your brain that sitting alone in your home or office just won’t do. Your regulated working environments may lack the certain level of randomness that could be the key ingredient in a productive writing session. Just walking to get to the café might be beneficial to your unconscious mind, providing you with the essential stimulus and inspiration. Maybe you meet someone you haven’t seen for a while. Maybe your favorite song from your high school years suddenly plays inside the café, inspiring you to find the missing word you were looking for in your writing. And you get the chance to drink some quality coffee (hopefully). All these are directly related to the highly important notion of reward, a psychological weapon you can use to boost your psyche at times when writing scientific prose just doesn’t seem to be the best thing in the world. To put it simply, more espresso means less depresso. The concept of reward is a very powerful motive. You can use it to force yourself to do things you don’t feel like doing. Days will come where your motivation levels are extremely low and you won’t feel like writing at all. Don’t spend time thinking about it. Just go out to the nearest café. Any type of reward would be welcome at such a time, no matter the cost. I believe that the most convenient reward you can provide yourself with and enable you to do some writing work, is a simple cup of coffee. It’s at least something. It certainly will be a million times better than staying inside and trying to fight against your inner rebelling self that wants to procrastinate and do anything other than write. So pay for the damn coffee and get that cookie as well. Note that caffeine is one of the most used psychoactive substances in the world. Be also aware of the fact that the beneficial effects of caffeine (concentration and mental focus are the most important for us here) decrease over time with regular consumption, resulting in the manifestation of caffeine tolerance. In other words, you need ever-increasing amounts of caffeine per day to reap its benefits. Therefore, I advise you to properly regulate your caffeine intake in your everyday life, somedays having more, others a bit less. If you can also cycle off caffeine for a day or two, I promise you that on the third day, a regular cup of coffee will be the most pleasant experience you are going to have! I used the example of working from cafés, to demonstrate the importance of a reward system and of how such a system can positively influence your writing progress. Reward here was getting the coffee and being exposed to a different environment. But you don’t have to restrict yourself to the types of rewards or workplaces that I mentioned. They just happened to be the most easily accessible to me. It could very well be the case that some other types of rewards or workplaces are more suitable for you. So, take advantage of them when you see fit to do so. The argument of having several working environments (and the subsequent potential rewards that they bring with them) is extremely important. Only if you have several options available, can you make a choice of a working environment that might be better for you at a specific time. You have to choose the right place, at the right time. If you have only one standard workplace though, then you don’t give yourself a choice. It’s always good to have a choice, so don’t restrain yourself even before starting the writing process. Otherwise, chances are that you are most likely going to suffer during the writing ordeal that is the PhD thesis. Select several diverse workplaces, and if applicable, make the corresponding environments suitable for the upcoming writing task.
