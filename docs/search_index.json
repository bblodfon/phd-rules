As you may already know, to obtain a doctorate degree and finally be called a Doctor1, you need to submit a dissertation towards the end of your studies. During my efforts to produce a respectable, well-written, paper-based PhD thesis, I followed a personal list of rules. It is these rules, and the principles behind them, that I present in this rulebook. They are the direct result of my personal travel through the PhD thesis writing ordeal and the lessons I learned from that experience. I cannot really say if these guidelines are also applicable to a monograph-based thesis or a thesis about a subject in a research field entirely different from my own (my PhD was in Computational Biology), but I would expect some of them to be. You can find several sources on the internet nowadays, providing advice on how to write a PhD thesis. Two excellent books exist on the subject (Eco 2015; Murray 2017), as well as several online blogs and presentations. I admit that I haven’t thoroughly read all of these sources but I have noticed similarities between the guidelines presented in some of these works and my rules. All in all, it might be wise to check them out as well if you are interested in good advice on thesis writing. Getting expert opinion never hurts, or so they say. How can I write more efficiently? How can I organize the work that needs to be done in a manner that will increase my productivity? How to better prepare myself psychologically for the task ahead? How to regulate external factors to my advantage? If you are struggling with similar questions, then keep reading. In the end, I found some answers to the above questions - at least ones that seemed to work for me, and helped me get the job done. I formulated these answers into a list of guidelines. I also tried to extract the essence or central idea behind each rule. This allowed me to analyze in depth the underlying principles that are key to understanding why these rules actually work (or I think that they do). Therefore, every rule has its own theoretical background, in case you want to know more details about why each one was included in the first place. Who is the intended reader? To answer this question, let me start by saying that a PhD thesis is not a paper or an essay. You can not finish a PhD thesis in five days of intense writing and use the weekend to do some refinements, all while having pizza every day to boost your psychological well-being. But a scientific paper can be written this way actually (and surely without the pizza). Numerous guidelines exist for writing a paper, and an excellent advice is to structure it in the Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion format to facilitate your writing in an efficient manner. Nonetheless, if you are a person that thinks you can write a scientific thesis in one week, then the following text is not meant for you (and I wish you good luck!). The presented rules are aimed towards the strugglers, the good-working people who may turn lazy and procrastinate when they even think of the prospect of having to write scientific prose. These people usually think “I am better at the lab or when writing code,” “too much effort to produce almost nothing,” “extremely boring” and “who is going to read it anyway?” The sad fact is that such thoughts are true most of the time. You will need to overcome such tricks of the mind in order to finish your thesis. It is clearly a psychological battle. Moreover, the process of writing a PhD thesis is similar to writing a book, so it is really hard work, apart from being mentally and psychologically draining. Given its serious nature (it’s a doctoral degree after all), it makes sense to be properly prepared for it. The presented rules are a step towards this direction and may thus be of help to you. A few words about the layout of the rules are in order. The first five rules relate to things that need to be in place and figured out before you even start writing. The next three rules explain what to do everyday during the writing period. That’s why I have split this collection of rules to Before and During writing. The Epilogue provides some general advice and states the final take-home messages (so no rules in there). I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this text and that it proves useful to your goals. John Zobolas, July 2021. As in “Dr. John,” a title with a nice ring to it!

I believe that the answer is simple: the thesis is the story of your PhD journey, written by the main character (that’s you). So how to shape such a story? Let’s start from the beginning. You are about to write a scientific thesis and for the sake of the argument let’s say that you already have some results to write about or even better, papers published.2 You have to have some background knowledge as well. Your work has to fit in a larger picture, be part of a larger story. To write your PhD story you need to know the basic constituents of a thesis. In a nutshell, the PhD thesis incorporates three components. First, it lays out the contextual framework of the scientific subject you are writing about (background). Second, it presents the problems that you as a scientist faced, along with what you did to solve them (results). Lastly, it includes some discussion points and potential future work. To formulate such a story and embellish it with the details of your own PhD journey, the knowledge you’ve acquired over the course of your PhD will play a significant role. The most prominent source of such knowledge is scientific literature. Most people think that the PhD thesis is a strict, formal writing work. These people are wrong. You see, scientific writing does not necessarily mean the absence of creative writing. To write a story, you need to have a certain degree of imagination. But to integrate your scientific results into such a story and create a coherent narrative, you need to know about the subject you will be writing about. This means that you need to have a certain level of background knowledge as well, the main source of which is scientific papers. That’s also where you are going to find the citations you need for your thesis. Of course the papers are not the only source of knowledge you will have access to during your PhD. Taking advantage of other forms of knowledge dissemination, such as courses, workshops and conferences is your own responsibility. Use every possible means necessary to learn as much as possible about the subject you will be writing about. The discussions you have with your supervisors and colleagues are also going to be decisive in shaping your knowledge. “To write, you need to read” as many people have said. If you have reached the final stage of your PhD and haven’t read a single paper (which I think is almost impossible), you are like a soldier standing on the front line with no weapons. Your chances are better if you stand prepared for the battle ahead. So, arm yourself with knowledge. Start reading early in your PhD. You will still have a pile of papers to read during the writing phase of your PhD. The main point here is that the core of the reading material should be read before that phase starts. Read the damn papers before you start writing. If you have no results, in any form that satisfy the criteria set by your academic institution, well, that’s another problem entirely, one that I honestly hope that you find a solution for. Either way, my assumption here is that you have some results to write about, which will be integrated into the story of your PhD thesis.↩︎ "],["before_2.html", "Rule 2: Read abstracts and reviews", " Rule 2: Read abstracts and reviews "],["before_3.html", "Rule 3: Organize your story into chapters", " Rule 3: Organize your story into chapters "],["before_4.html", "Rule 4: Make a time-wise plan", " Rule 4: Make a time-wise plan "],["before_5.html", "Rule 5: Select several diverse workplaces", " Rule 5: Select several diverse workplaces "],["during_6.html", "During writing Rule 6: Short focused daily sessions", " During writing Rule 6: Short focused daily sessions "],["during_7.html", "Rule 7: Write one new paragraph per day", " Rule 7: Write one new paragraph per day "],["during_8.html", "Rule 8: Read one paper per day", " Rule 8: Read one paper per day "],["epilogue.html", "Epilogue", " Epilogue "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
