<h2><strong>Rule 6:</strong> Short focused daily sessions</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Every day, organize the writing work in short focused sessions, and carry out each session in a different place.
Let’s break down each part of the previous sentence and explain why it is important to do exactly that.
First, I would like to lay out my empirical opinion about the process of writing and its impact on our psyche.
This assessment is based solely on my personal experience (but maybe you find it familiar).
Simply put, writing is a tricky business.
I call it tricky because writing does not induce the same level of accomplishment or achievement as normal PhD work does, though it may require a substantial amount of time.
I believe that the main reason for this is largely biological in nature.
Writing (and thinking thereof) is great, but getting your hands dirty trying to fix things or work out problems and discuss potential solutions with other fellow colleagues simply feels better.
You get a better kick when you see the world change due to your actions.
Writing is equivalent to inaction in that sense, i.e.
typing some words and phrases in your computer will not directly affect the world in any way.
Compare 4 hours of intense writing with the same amount of time spent doing some of your normal PhD work, and let’s assume that you are very productive on both fronts.
For example, you may have achieved notable progress in your writing at the end of the session, by refining already written text or adding some new paragraphs.
On the other hand, executing a couple of simulations and analyzing the respective results or fixing a bug in your code and seeing your software successfully compiling and passing the tests are practical work examples that will make you feel a larger sense of accomplishment.
Comparatively speaking, writing feels like too much work for nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>Nonetheless, you are bravely entering a period of writing, which you know will feel less satisfactory in every possible dimension compared to your normal, everyday PhD work.
How can you motivate yourself to go through that? Some people would say “Well, I will just do my 8 hours per day + some overtime, rest on the weekends (or not) and all will be fine.”
Sorry, but this strategy might not be optimal.
The reason is that you can not exceed 3-4 hours of productive writing per day on average.
You can not expect yourself to do more than that.
Moreover, staying in one place for 8+ hours to just write is the worst possible choice you can make psychologically speaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>You are going to continually face writing blocks, characterized by the lack of stimulus needed to produce new text.
You will be constantly distracted by random thoughts.
You will become demotivated.
With long hours of writing, you risk falling into patterns where you read what you think you’ve written and not what actually is written.
So writing quality will also suffer in the long term.
Don’t fall prey to such tricks of the mind.
You have to give your brain some time to let the thoughts sink in.
Pauses are important for this to happen.
It is a million times better to just let go of your writing and come back to finish it later, when you will be fresh again.
Stretch the writing across the span of a day to make each individual writing session more productive.
Also, staying in the same place might be counterproductive to this.
That’s where the diverse working environments fit in (see previous rule).
Go to a place, do a session, leave.
Later in the day, you will do the next session somewhere else.
These sessions can be from 45 minutes to around 3 hours.
Follow this rule diligently.
Aim for at least two such sessions a day.
If you can achieve your daily writing goal in one session, all the better then.
My advice is to have the first session early in the morning, after you have your breakfast (and coffee!), since that is when your cognitive power is at its peak.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>Now you know what you need to do: be a constantly moving writer! There is an adventurous side to this that you should definitely exploit for your own benefit.
The last and most significant piece of the puzzle that makes the strategy of small focused sessions work, is consistency.
Namely, you have to make this sacrifice: you have to write every day.
The most successful writers are people who write every day.
Make no excuses.
Isn’t the PhD thesis the most important work-related task during the last stages of your PhD? Take it seriously then, commit yourself to it.
It might be that one day you are more productive than usual and successfully complete your daily writing goals (see next two rules) in just one session.
This does not mean that you can take a break the next day.
You see, writing a PhD thesis is more like running a marathon, not a 100m sprint.
You have to keep a steady rhythm.
Your will to keep doing every day what you set out to do, is what is going to make a difference in the long run.
The work from each session will be insignificant.
The work from a week of everyday sessions will be at least something.
Stopping for the weekend or for holidays will only produce a gap, an irregularity.
Would you stop a marathon race to take a nap? Or just stop to replenish your power levels using an energy drink and keep going? Reflect on what this writing project means for you and once you start, do it wholeheartedly.</p>
