<h2><strong>Rule 5:</strong> Select several diverse workplaces</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Continuing from the previous rules, now you know what to do to have the proper background (read papers) and how to read more efficiently (read abstract and reviews mostly).
You also know how you can lay out your upcoming writing work in a document (the skeleton of the story) and make a time-wise plan with regard to when you are going to start and finish the writing.
An extremely important factor that will influence your writing days is the environment where you will be doing the writing.
This is one of the most important rules in the present guideline list.
My argument here is two-fold: first, make sure you check and have your working environment ready for the task ahead and second, have at your disposal several options for places that you could use to do some writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>But first things first.
When the prospect of writing a PhD thesis is on the horizon, usually we resort to the most suitable of all places to complete such a task: our home.
The reasons are multiple.
Quiet, which makes it easy to focus.
No disturbances, no interactions either.
Easy to regulate and make it fit to your needs and standards.
Not to mention, access to chicken and toilet without too much of a trouble.
Nonetheless, there might still be things that require your immediate attention to make it the ideal environment for the ensuing writing work.
For example, do you have a proper screen (if that’s what is best for you), comfortable chair and desk? Access to some decent view which is always nice to have? I can not advise you on what is the perfect writing home environment since this is largely personal, but I can insist that you spend the time required to make it as ideal for you as possible.
Make sure that the basic preconditions are there to efficiently work from home.
If you have already passed one (or more) corona quarantines, then you know exactly what I am talking about.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>So, home is one place where you will be doing some writing.
What’s our next candidate? Well, usually our working place.
Since you are writing a PhD thesis, I would guess that it is your office at a university.
Apply the same reasoning here and think, “What can I do to make my work office a better place, suitable for the upcoming writing work?” You could add some family pictures for inspiration perhaps.
Is the surface of the desk clean, with no coffee cups or papers scattered here and there? If not, then how do you expect to write something ordered in such a chaotic environment? Maybe you can start by cleaning your desk, a certain level of tidiness can surely be of some help.
Or maybe you can forget all about working from the office, since it is a cubicle workspace with lots of other students and you are annoyed by that.
Then, how about the university library? Or some other cozy place in the university that you may know of? An inside cafeteria perhaps, at suitable times? A nice suggestion is to book a specific room for some hours once every week, motivating you to be in that place and do some writing.
All in all, a university can be the host of several writing spots which you should know about beforehand, so do your spatial research as well!</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>Having a provision of different places (and backup places) suitable for writing sessions, is a central element to this rule.
The keyword here is diversity.
It is one of the few principles that you can apply to break the monotony of writing.
Ok, so you have all your standard workplaces (home and office) figured out.
Sometimes we need the absolute quiet of our home, sometimes we get inspired by having a conversation in our office and seeing a few of our university colleagues.
Great.
Now extend this concept a bit further.
How about working from a café for a change?
Cafés can be fairly quiet places during regular working days and hours.
I like to view them as libraries with a bit more noise than usual and constant music in the background, a combination that makes up for an alternative working environment.
Coordinating also with a friend might actually be a good idea.
Being voluntarily exposed to social environments might trigger thoughts in your brain that sitting alone in your home or office just won’t do.
Your regulated working environments may lack the certain level of randomness that could be the key ingredient in a productive writing session.
Just walking to get to the café might be beneficial to your unconscious mind, providing you with the essential stimulus and inspiration.
Maybe you meet someone you haven’t seen for a while.
Maybe your favorite song from your high school years suddenly plays inside the café, inspiring you to find the missing word you were looking for in your writing.
And you get the chance to drink some quality coffee (hopefully).
All these are directly related to the highly important notion of reward, a psychological weapon you can use to boost your psyche at times when writing scientific prose just doesn’t seem to be the best thing in the world.
To put it simply, <em>more espresso means less depresso</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>The concept of reward is a very powerful motive.
You can use it to force yourself to do things you don’t feel like doing.
Days will come where your motivation levels are extremely low and you won’t feel like writing at all.
Don’t spend time thinking about it.
Just go out to the nearest café.
Any type of reward would be welcome at such a time, no matter the cost.
I believe that the most convenient reward you can provide yourself with and enable you to do some writing work, is a simple cup of coffee.
It’s at least something.
It certainly will be a million times better than staying inside and trying to fight against your inner rebelling self that wants to procrastinate and do anything other than write.
So pay for the damn coffee and get that cookie as well.
Note that caffeine is one of the most used psychoactive substances in the world.
Be also aware of the fact that the beneficial effects of caffeine (concentration and mental focus are the most important for us here) decrease over time with regular consumption, resulting in the manifestation of caffeine tolerance.
In other words, you need ever-increasing amounts of caffeine per day to reap its benefits.
Therefore, I advise you to properly regulate your caffeine intake in your everyday life, somedays having more, others a bit less.
If you can also cycle off caffeine for a day or two, I promise you that on the third day, a regular cup of coffee will be the most pleasant experience you are going to have!</p>
</div>
<div class="indent">
<p>I used the example of working from cafés, to demonstrate the importance of a reward system and of how such a system can positively influence your writing progress.
Reward here was getting the coffee and being exposed to a different environment.
But you don’t have to restrict yourself to the types of rewards or workplaces that I mentioned.
They just happened to be the most easily accessible to me.
It could very well be the case that some other types of rewards or workplaces are more suitable for you.
So, take advantage of them when you see fit to do so.
The argument of having several working environments (and the subsequent potential rewards that they bring with them) is extremely important.
Only if you have several options available, can you make a choice of a working environment that might be better for you at a specific time.
You have to choose the right place, at the right time.
If you have only one standard workplace though, then you don’t give yourself a choice.
It’s always good to have a choice, so don’t restrain yourself even before starting the writing process.
Otherwise, chances are that you are most likely going to suffer during the writing ordeal that is the PhD thesis.</p>
